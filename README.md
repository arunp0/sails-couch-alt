# sails-couch-alt

Provides an alternate access mechanism to Apache Couchdb from Sails.js & Waterline.

The core idea is,

Create a single database for all models (than one database per model)
Identify models by an doc_type attribute
Create a doc_type == 'metadata' document for each document type (Analogous to _design docs)
Automatically generate simple indexed views that is accessible from the find function (Inspired by the original couchdb adapter)
Ability to switch between all couch variants supported by nano


### Installation

To install this adapter, run:

```sh
$ npm install sails-couch-alt (Not deployed in npm registry yet. Coming soon)
```




### Usage

This adapter exposes the following methods:

###### `find()`

Find by id, find by where conditions.
For each where condition, if a design doc is not present a new one is created,
using a templated map funcion. TODO: Add more flexibility in creating views


###### `create()`
Does a nano.insert() by updating the id to _id column.


###### `update()`
Does a nano.insert taking into account the _rev property


###### `destroy()`
Finds the records specified by the where condition and, sets the _deleted property.




### Interfaces

>TODO:
>Specify the interfaces this adapter will support.
>e.g. `This adapter implements the [semantic]() and [queryable]() interfaces.`
> For more information, check out this repository's [FAQ](./FAQ.md) and the [adapter interface reference](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/adapter-specification.md) in the Sails docs.


### Development

Check out **Connections** in the Sails docs, or see the `config/connections.js` file in a new Sails project for information on setting up adapters.

## Getting started
It's usually pretty easy to add your own adapters for integrating with proprietary systems or existing open APIs.  For most things, it's as easy as `require('some-module')` and mapping the appropriate methods to match waterline semantics.  To get started:

1. Fork this repository
2. Set up your `README.md` and `package.json` file.  Sails.js adapter module names are of the form sails-*, where * is the name of the datastore or service you're integrating with.
3. Build your adapter.




### Running the tests

Configure the interfaces you plan to support (and targeted version of Sails/Waterline) in the adapter's `package.json` file:

```javascript
{
  //...
  "sails": {
  	"adapter": {
	    "sailsVersion": "~0.10.0",
	    "implements": [
	      "semantic",
	      "queryable"
	    ]
	  }
  }
}
```

In your adapter's directory, run:

```sh
$ npm test
```


## Publish your adapter

> You're welcome to write proprietary adapters and use them any way you wish--
> these instructions are for releasing an open-source adapter.

1. Create a [new public repo](https://github.com/new) and add it as a remote (`git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/sails-youradaptername.git)
2. Make sure you attribute yourself as the author and set the license in the package.json to "MIT".
3. Run the tests one last time.
4. Do a [pull request to sails-docs](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/compare/) adding your repo to `data/adapters.js`.  Please let us know about any special instructions for usage/testing.
5. We'll update the documentation with information about your new adapter
6. Then everyone will adore you with lavish praises.  Mike might even send you jelly beans.

7. Run `npm version patch`
8. Run `git push && git push --tags`
9. Run `npm publish`
